# Desktop~~rat~~Pet

![](./preview.mp4)

A desktop pet app thingy? written using bevy.

Features:

- Dragging
- Wandering
- Mouse Following
- 3 Skins
- A couple of animations pretty bad though tbh
- Linux & Windows support
- You can open 10 rats at once and still have decent performance

Todo:

- Support multiple rats open from the same game instance
- Config options maybe?
- Add assets to binary
- Maybe some new functionality to the pet the limits are endless
- Make 200 rats at once possible and pretty workable
